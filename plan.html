  <p>&lt;Matthew Spina &amp; jc463363&gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The mini Site mission is to create a fully functional website for the company of Training Zone. By creating the Training Zone website and showing the great offers that the company has shown, it is hoped that the income of the company will increase dramticlly. The website will also aim to increase and repeat customes. </p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> By exmaining the hit counter, we will see whether the website is succesful in reaching customers, by counting how many people have visited the page. Furthermore, By examining the statsitics of the comapny such as their income and customers, we will truely see if the site is succesful. We will knwo this if the Training Zone has increased its income and or the amount of cosutmers they have. Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at.</p>
